```
As a user,
So that I can check if my class has a spec file,
I would like the name to be highlighted in red, until a spec has file been created

As a user,
So that I can check if my method has a test,
I would like it to be highlighted red until a test has been written.

As a user,
So that I can customise the amount of linting,
